                I am a passionate STEM professional with formal qualifications in Applied Chemistry from Curtin University in Perth
                and a post-graduate degree in Computing from The University of Melbourne. Currently based in Brisbane and working for  
                BHP’s Maintenance & Engineering Centre of Excellence as an Asset Health Specialist. It is a
                key role in enabling an enterprise system at BHP for managing the reliability of assets and equipment via
                process automation and advanced predictive analysis.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have lived and worked in most major cities of Australia as well as across regional WA working 
                in a range of interesting roles from Corrosion Engineering of subsea pipelines to being the key 
                developer of  a commercially viable Lithium Carbonate process. My constant interaction with big 
                data has put me on the pathway of Data Science and it is the field I wish to pursue further. 
                Being part of She Codes 2020 has been instrumental in this continuing journey, while also 
                exposing me to the wonderful world of web development!!
            </p>
            <p>
                As a strong believer that  science and technology are key to creating a sustainable future
                for the generations to come, I am seeking opportunities to collaborate with Not for Profit groups
                working on projects that support either Environment causes like Decarbonisation, Water and Waste
                Management or Empowerment of disadvantaged social groups by use of Technology. 
            <p>
            </p>
                Outside of work and study, I enjoy motorcycle riding, learning new things like dancing and culturally enriching
                travel experiences.

              <h3>Twitter Sentiment Analysis</h3>
              <p>
                Group project during Masters in Computing, using Cloud Computing 
                principles to perform Sentiment Analysis on Melbourne's Twitter Data  
                to identify rating of "happiness" across suburbs. The technology used for front-end 
                implementation is HTML/CSS/Java-script and a Bootstrap framework for responsiveness. 
                A JS library ‘Highmaps’ and ‘Highcharts’ has been used for analytics at front-end
                vel. CouchDB’s instance was used for storage and retrieval purposes using the RESTful API
                for data manipulation. Data was collected from AURIN as a one-off for corrleation analysis
                with suburb profiling and twitter sentiment analysis. For implementing architecture, Nectar
                Cloud service from UniMelb was used as a platform. Nectar provided access for virtual cores
                from an Ubuntu OpenStack environment.

              <p>
                  This project was completed using Python for data processing with the library Plotly for graphical display of the
                  analysed data. Weather Data was consumed in JSON format. The purpose was to process and return meaningful 
                  insights from the data as well as enabling automated daily and weekly reporting.

              <h3>Scholarship Directory</h3>
              <p>
                  This project was completed as part of the SheCodes Australia 2020 Brisbane Cohort 
                  Final Project, delivered in 3 weeks with a team of 3 other developers. Finding tech 
                  opportunities (scholarships, programs, conferences, etc.) often only happens by 
                  chance or word of mouth. We created a solution called Word Of Mouth, aimed at helping
                  connect minorities in Tech with scholarship and similar opportunitites available to them. 
                  The solution was in the form of a website created using Django REST framework as the backend,
                  REACT JS for front-end development and deployed using Heroku.
