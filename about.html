    <p>
        I am a passionate STEM profession with a focus on leveraging data from an array of sources to enable optimal decision making for business entities. I have had the opportunity to work in a range of companies in my 10 years of career. This has indoctrinated in me the skills to identify opportunities for business improvement as well as the discipline of working and leading teams to respond with creative solutions. In particular, I am an advocate of standardization, process automation and predictive analytics.

        Currently, I am working for the Maintenance & Engineering Centre of Excellence at BHP. I am accountable for providing subject matter proficiency on the field of Tribology (science of wear & friction) as well as leading the analytics of the asset health data from open-cut & underground mining equipment to enable attainment of strategy life. The role is pivotal in paving the pathway to predictive maintenance via systematization of learnings along with automation of condition monitoring processes. I am excited to the on the SHE CODES 2020 journey to be surrounded by like minded women as as well having the power of a strong board of mentors behind us to thrust us in the right direction! Formally I have a Bachelor in Analytical & Forensic Chemistry and a Masters in Computing. Success for me out of this would be to finally feel confident in calling myself a programmer and also setting myself on the path to becoming a Data Scientist and a STEM supporter, particularly for disadvantaged young adults.
        
        In my free time I like to ride motorcycles, read books (when not glued to my phone), check out new places and try new hobbies from scuba diving to mountain biking!
